# Lesson 2 - Notes App

This is a basic notes app that's created using Flutter. There are two tutorials for this app, the [first](https://youtu.be/QP6GtVUfpIg) one goes over the UI design for the app, and the [second]() one goes over making the database to store the notes. Take a look at the branches to which have each part for the lesson to follow with the videos. Do note that there might be a few changes compared to the videos. Please feel free to comment on the videos for any questions or create issue on this repository!
